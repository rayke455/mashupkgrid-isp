/**
 * Standalone pairing/smoke-test entry point — run this directly (`pnpm --filter
 * @mashupkgrid/whatsapp connect`) to link this machine to a real WhatsApp account and confirm
 * the connection actually works. Not part of the worker app's normal startup: pairing needs a
 * human present to scan the QR code, so it can't happen unattended the way the worker's other
 * background services do.
 *
 * First run: prints a QR code in this terminal. Open WhatsApp on your phone -> Settings (or the
 * ⋮ menu) -> Linked Devices -> Link a Device, and scan it. Once paired, the session is saved to
 * WHATSAPP_AUTH_STATE_PATH (packages/config) and every future run reconnects automatically with
 * no QR code needed, until that folder is deleted or the phone unlinks the device.
 *
 * Sends a "connected" confirmation message to WHATSAPP_TEST_RECIPIENT (your own number, in
 * E.164 — e.g. +2547XXXXXXXX) if that env var is set, then leaves the connection open so you can
 * watch incoming messages logged to the console. Ctrl+C to stop.
