/**
 * How often a router checks in, and so how long its silence means "offline".

 * Each check-in downloads the report script and posts the results over HTTPS. On a small router —
 * a hAP lite has one 650 MHz MIPS core and 32 MB — two TLS handshakes a minute plus the hotspot
 * self-check kept the CPU at 100%: check-ins piled up, the console froze, and phones timed out
 * loading the sign-in page. Small routers therefore check in every 5 minutes; everything else
 * every minute. The report script sets the router's own scheduler to match (buildHeartbeatScript),
 * and every "is it online?" decision allows 2.5 intervals.
