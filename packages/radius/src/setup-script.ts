 *
 *  It is a heuristic, and honestly so:
 *    - A customer whose own device legitimately sits behind a router (a travel router in a hotel
 *      room, some MiFi units) is blocked even though only one person is using it.
 *    - An operating system with a non-standard default TTL is misjudged in either direction.
 *    - Anyone who knows this exists can set their TTL to 65 and defeat it in one command.
 *  So it raises the cost of casual sharing — which is nearly all of it — rather than stopping a
