 * The catalog of everything the worker does on a schedule, and the Redis contract it uses to
 * report back on it.
 *
 * Three consumers share this file, and each drifted from the others before it existed:
 * - `apps/worker` registers the repeatable jobs from it, so an interval lives in exactly one
 *   place (BullMQ keys a repeatable job by its interval, so a stale duplicate schedule is the
 *   usual symptom of editing one copy).
 * - `apps/api` reads the run records the worker leaves behind and serves them to the dashboard.
 * - `apps/web` renders the catalog, so a job is never listed in the UI without being registered
 *   in the worker, or vice versa.
